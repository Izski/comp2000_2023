# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it. It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method. Try them out. You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints

```
Red vs. Blue
```
